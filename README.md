## Overview of Project
This analysis was for Steve, who had clients interested in green stocks. The clients were initially interested in "DQ" stocks, but after analysis the returns didn't look promising. Steve then requested I create buttons that allow him to quickly analyze all green stocks by year. He then asked me to refactor the code so he could expand the dataset to analyze the whole stock market, not just the initial green stocks.

### Results

## Summary
Advantages of refactoring
- Uses existing script
- Improved quality
- Faster run time
- More organized and easier to read

Disadvantages of refactoring
- Retesting functionality
- Strong understanding of VBA needed to improve efficiency
- Time consuming
- Existing code doesn't account for future dataset

For this project, refactoring the code wasn't necessary. Original run times were fast for the existing dataset. However, Steve wants to expand the dataset to analyze the whole stock market. This refactored code *should* run faster for the larger dataset, but hasn't been tested for that future dataset and would still need updates to the tickers array.
